# 📺 Netflix Homepage Clone — HTML & CSS (Fully Responsive)

This is a **fully responsive Netflix Homepage UI Clone** built purely using **HTML and CSS**.  
The goal of this project was to recreate the visual experience of the Netflix landing page and strengthen my front-end fundamentals by building a real-world UI layout **pixel-by-pixel** from scratch.

> **Note:** This is not an official Netflix product — just a UI clone created for learning purposes.
